<h1>Project Title: Flower Animation</h1>
<p>Kash Chauhan</p>


This project showcases a beautiful flower animation created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The animation dynamically generates flower petals and animates their growth and movement, resulting in a visually captivating display.

## Features
- Dynamic generation of flower petals.
- Smooth animations for petal growth and rotation.
- Configurable options for colors, sizes, and animation speed.
- Lightweight and runs in the browser with no external dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-animation-js.git
   cd flower-animation-js
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Edit the `config` object in the JavaScript file to customize the animation:

   ```javascript
   const config = {
       petalCount: 20, // Number of petals per flower
       petalColors: ['#FFB6C1', '#FF69B4', '#FF1493'], // Array of colors
       animationSpeed: 2, // Speed of petal animations in seconds
       flowerSize: 100 // Diameter of the flower in pixels
   };
   ```

2. Refresh the browser to see your changes.

## How It Works

The animation is implemented using:
- **HTML5 Canvas** for drawing petals and animating them.
- **JavaScript** for creating and animating the flower elements dynamically.
- **CSS** for styling the background and other elements (if needed).
